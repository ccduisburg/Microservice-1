# Microservice Project

### What are microservices ? 
Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are
 - Highly maintainable and testable
 - Loosely coupled
 - Independently deployable
 - Organized around business capabilities
 - Owned by a small team
 
The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
